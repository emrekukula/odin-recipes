    <strong>Description</strong>
      <p>These boiled chicken wontons are delicately flavored and would go great in a chicken-based soup.
      </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
      <ul>
          <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, minced</li>
          <li>1 egg</li>
          <li>1 green onion, minced</li>
          <li>1½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>50 wonton wrappers</li>
          <li>2 cups cold water</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Mix chicken, egg, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, vegetable oil, and salt in a large bowl until evenly combined.</li>
          <li>Scoop about 1 teaspoon chicken mixture and place into the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten 2 adjacent edges of the wrapper with water and fold into a triangle. Connect the two lower points of the wrapper and moisten to seal and make a hat shape. Repeat with remaining chicken and wonton wrappers.</li>
          <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Stir wontons into boiling water. Add 1/2 cup cold water and allow water to return to a boil. Repeat boiling with another 1/2 cup cold water. Wontons are ready when chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        </ol>
